# ðŸ§ª Unit Test 005: Overloading Arguments Resolution

## ðŸ“˜ Preface

Java allows method overloading and supports varargs, basically methods that accept a variable number of arguments. When both a general varargs method and a more specific overload exist, the compiler follows a strict resolution hierarchy. This test demonstrates how Java resolves method calls when both match, but one is more specific than the other.

## ðŸ”¬ Test Case

```java
public class T_005_OverloadingResolution {

  public static class TestClass {

    public static int method(Object... args) {
      return 0;
    }

    public static int method(String arg, Object... args) {
      return 1;
    }
  }

  @Test
  public void test() {
    Assertions.assertSame(1, TestClass.method("test"));
    Assertions.assertSame(0, TestClass.method((Object) "test"));
  }
}
```


## ðŸ”Ž Why This Matters

Java resolves overloaded methods by most specific match. In the first case, the method with the `String` parameter is more specific than `Object...`, so it is chosen. In the second case, no `String` overload matches, so the general varargs method is selected. Misunderstanding this behaviour can lead to the wrong overload being called, a common trap when working with APIs that use varargs heavily, though IDEs normally helps out the developer by highlighting the method being called.
